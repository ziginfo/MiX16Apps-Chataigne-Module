## MiX16Apps control with chataigne

OSC ports must be set in the OSC Settings in the Option-Menu; they can be freely configured;    
try Input Port : 8000 and Output Port : 9001  

Note that, even if you see the address boxes in the Options of the MiX16App filled, you may need to select them again and confirm with ENTER to activate OSC-Remote !   
note also that you can configure freely all MIDI commands with the MIDI-Editor of the App. The MIDI Editor is accessible in the “Tools” Menu of the App.     
Every new MIDI-command will create automatically a new Custom-OSC-Command that you can than add to your Chataigne Script !

This opens a whole bunch of possibilites to customize the OSC-Remote.
